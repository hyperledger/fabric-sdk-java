version: 1.0.0

#
# The client section is SDK-specific. The sample below is for the node.js SDK
#
client:
  # Which organization does this application instance belong to? The value must be the name of an org
  # defined under "organizations"
  organization: Org1

  # Some SDKs support pluggable KV stores, the properties under "credentialStore"
  # are implementation specific
  credentialStore:
    # [Optional]. Specific to FileKeyValueStore.js or similar implementations in other SDKs. Can be others
    # if using an alternative impl. For instance, CouchDBKeyValueStore.js would require an object
    # here for properties like url, db name, etc.
    path: "/tmp/hfc-kvs"

    # [Optional]. Specific to the CryptoSuite implementation. Software-based implementations like
    # CryptoSuite_ECDSA_AES.js in node SDK requires a key store. PKCS#11 based implementations does
    # not.
    cryptoStore:
      # Specific to the underlying KeyValueStore that backs the crypto key store.
      path: "/tmp/hfc-cvs"

    # [Optional]. Specific to Composer environment
    wallet: wallet-name

#
# [Optional]. But most apps would have this section so that channel objects can be constructed
# based on the content below. If an app is creating channels, then it likely will not need this
# section.
#
channels:
  # name of the channel
  foo:
    # Required. list of orderers designated by the application to use for transactions on this
    # channel. This list can be a result of access control ("org1" can only access "ordererA"), or
    # operational decisions to share loads from applications among the orderers.  The values must
    # be "names" of orgs defined under "organizations/peers"
    orderers:
      - orderer.example.com

    # Required. list of peers from participating orgs
    peers:
      peer0.org1.example.com:
        # [Optional]. will this peer be sent transaction proposals for endorsement? The peer must
        # have the chaincode installed. The app can also use this property to decide which peers
        # to send the chaincode install request. Default: true
        endorsingPeer: true

        # [Optional]. will this peer be sent query proposals? The peer must have the chaincode
        # installed. The app can also use this property to decide which peers to send the
        # chaincode install request. Default: true
        chaincodeQuery: true

        # [Optional]. will this peer be sent query proposals that do not require chaincodes, like
        # queryBlock(), queryTransaction(), etc. Default: true
        ledgerQuery: true

        # [Optional]. will this peer be the target of the SDK's listener registration? All peers can
        # produce events but the app typically only needs to connect to one to listen to events.
        # Default: true
        eventSource: true

      peer1.org1.example.com:
        endorsingPeer: true
        chaincodeQuery: true
        ledgerQuery: true
        eventSource: false

    # [Optional]. what chaincodes are expected to exist on this channel? The application can use
    # this information to validate that the target peers are in the expected state by comparing
    # this list with the query results of getInstalledChaincodes() and getInstantiatedChaincodes()
    chaincodes:
      # the format follows the "cannonical name" of chaincodes by fabric code

    # [Optional]. Certificate Authorities issue certificates for identification purposes in a Fabric based
    # network. Typically certificates provisioning is done in a separate process outside of the
    # runtime network. Fabric-CA is a special certificate authority that provides a REST APIs for
    # dynamic certificate management (enroll, revoke, re-enroll). The following section is only for
    # Fabric-CA servers.
    certificateAuthorities:

    # [Optional]. If the application is going to make requests that are reserved to organization
    # administrators, including creating/updating channels, installing/instantiating chaincodes, it
    # must have access to the admin identity represented by the private key and signing certificate.
    # Both properties can be the PEM string or local path to the PEM file. Note that this is mainly for
    # convenience in development mode, production systems should not expose sensitive information
    # this way. The SDK should allow applications to set the org admin identity via APIs, and only use
    # this route as an alternative when it exists.
