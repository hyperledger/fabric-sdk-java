// Capabilities message defines the capabilities a particular binary must implement
// for that binary to be able to safely participate in the channel.  The capabilities
// message is defined at the /Channel level, the /Channel/Application level, and the
// /Channel/Orderer level.
//
// The /Channel level capabilties define capabilities which both the orderer and peer
// binaries must satisfy.  These capabilties might be things like a new MSP type,
// or a new policy type.
//
// The /Channel/Orderer level capabilties define capabilities which must be supported
// by the orderer, but which have no bearing on the behavior of the peer.  For instance
// if the orderer changes the logic for how it constructs new channels, only all orderers
// must agree on the new logic.  The peers do not need to be aware of this change as
// they only interact with the channel after it has been constructed.
//
// Finally, the /Channel/Application level capabilities define capabilities which the peer
// binary must satisfy, but which have no bearing on the orderer.  For instance, if the
// peer adds a new UTXO transaction type, or changes the chaincode lifecycle requirements,
// all peers must agree on the new logic.  However, orderers never inspect transactions
// this deeply, and therefore have no need to be aware of the change.
//
// The capabilities strings defined in these messages typically correspond to release
// binary versions (e.g. "V1.1"), and are used primarilly as a mechanism for a fully
// upgraded network to switch from one set of logic to a new one.
//
// Although for V1.1, the orderers must be upgraded to V1.1 prior to the rest of the
// network, going forward, because of the split between the /Channel, /Channel/Orderer
// and /Channel/Application capabilities.  It should be possible for the orderer and
// application networks to upgrade themselves independently (with the exception of any
// new capabilities defined at the /Channel level).

// message rather than a constant, so that we may extend capabilities with other fields
