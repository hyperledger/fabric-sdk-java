# Issues with these labels will never be considered stale
# CAUTION: These issues are likely to get _less_ attention since stale bot
# will never nag anyone about them. Stale bot just reflects the community's
# actual priorities and adding labels to this list will not change that.
# If issues you care about are going stale, you need to work with the
# community to raise their profile, e.g. add more information, reach out on
# Rocket.Chat, join a community call, etc.
# WARNING: Please do not change these labels without seeking community
# consensus first!
